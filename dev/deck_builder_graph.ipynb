      "Recommended card: A cheap black creature with menace that can be played early in the game, providing early pressure and helping establish board presence. This creature should have low power and toughness but ideally comes with an ability like generating a zombie token upon entering the battlefield to further support the zombie theme.\n",
      "Matching cards: index 0: **Diregraf Ghoul**: A black 1-mana Zombie creature. It has a power and toughness of 2/2.   **Role & Strengths**: Diregraf Ghoul serves as an early-game zombie token generator, allowing you to create additional threats or resources quickly. Its ability to tap upon entering the battlefield makes it slightly slower in combat but is often offset by its ability to generate tokens.  **Weaknesses**: It enters the battlefield tapped, which can delay its immediate impact on board presence compared to untapped creatures. Additionally, as a 2/2 for only one mana, it's somewhat fragile and may be easily dealt with by stronger opponents if left alone.  Overall, Diregraf Ghoul is a strong early-game play that helps bolster zombie tribal decks or those seeking quick board development.\n",
      "index 1: **Dread Summons**  - **Mana Cost**: {X}{B}{B}     - This is considered a strong cost for a sorcery. The additional black mana allows it to be flexible and powerful.  - **Keywords**: Mill     - This card causes each player to mill X cards, which can lead to significant board impact depending on the value of X chosen.  - **Role and Strengths**:     - Dread Summons is a mill deck enabler. It excels in decks that aim to deplete opponents' libraries while simultaneously generating threats.   - For every creature card milled by any player, you create a tapped 2/2 black Zombie token, providing potential board presence.   - It can be used defensively or offensively, depending on the context and number of creatures in players' graveyards.  - **Weaknesses**:     - The effectiveness is highly dependent on the value of X chosen. If opponents have fewer creature cards in their libraries, the token generation diminishes.   - Requires a well-timed play to maximize its potential, often needing prior setup or knowledge of your opponent's deck composition.\n",
      "index 2: **Hungry Ghoul**: A common black Zombie creature with 2 power and 2 toughness, costing {1}{B}. Hungry Ghoul offers versatility in combat by allowing you to sacrifice another creature to add a +1/+1 counter to it. This ability strengthens the Ghoul incrementally, enhancing its durability or offensive capability over time.  **Role**: Primarily used for board control, enabling aggressive plays by sacrificing weaker creatures to bolster a more significant threat. Its sacrifice requirement can also help manage your hand size and resource pool.  **Strengths**: The card's value increases with each sacrificed creature, making it efficient in decks that generate or support sacrifice mechanics. It's particularly strong in black-centric decks focused on creature interactions and removal strategies.  **Weaknesses**: Its reliance on sacrificing creatures means its power can be limited if you lack other expendable creatures to sacrifice. Additionally, without a sufficient number of creatures on the board, its ability becomes less impactful early game.\n",
      "index 3: **Vampire Spawn**  *Mana Cost:* {2}{B} (Moderate cost with a black mana component)  *Role:* Aggro creature  *Strengths:* - Provides an aggressive start by dealing damage and gaining life when it enters the battlefield. - Its ability triggers upon entering, making it effective in decks focused on maintaining or increasing life totals while pressuring opponents.  *Weaknesses:* - Relatively low power and toughness for a 3-cost creature, making it vulnerable to removal. - Requires an opponent's presence to activate its life-gain and damage-dealing ability, limiting utility if played first turn against an empty board.   Overall, Vampire Spawn is a strong early-game threat in aggro or lifegain strategies, but lacks staying power due to its lower toughness and reliance on opponents for its ability to be impactful.\n",
      "index 4: **Midnight Reaper**: A black Zombie Knight with power 3 and toughness 2. This rare creature costs {2}{B}, which is moderately difficult to cast.  **Role & Strengths**: Midnight Reaper thrives in decks focused on sacrificing creatures or those that frequently have creatures die, such as mill strategies. It synergizes well with effects that force opponents to kill your creatures or with cards that allow you to sacrifice them for value.  - **Self-Sacrifice Synergy**: Pairs excellently with spells or abilities that let you sacrifice creatures for additional benefits.    - **Mill Strategy**: Works effectively in mill decks, where drawing more cards is advantageous as you deplete an opponent's library.  **Weaknesses**:  - **Self-Damage**: The drawback of dealing 1 damage to yourself whenever a nontoken creature dies can be significant, especially if your creatures are dying rapidly due to board wipes or combat.    - **Situational Utility**: Its utility is highly dependent on the specific game plan and deck build. It may not perform well in decks that don't focus on creature sacrifices.  Overall, Midnight Reaper is a powerful card for decks built around sacrificing creatures but requires careful management of its self-damage ability to maximize its benefits.\n",

This is a fundamental issue as it renders your only card unusable unless you have no-land options (which typically do not exist in standard formats).\\n\\n2. **Single Creature Dependency**: With just one creature, the deck’s reliance on Diregraf Ghoul means that if it gets removed from the board or destroyed, there are no other creatures to fall back on.\\n\\n3. **Limited Synergy and Support**: A single zombie doesn’t provide enough support for a zombie-themed strategy, which usually benefits from multiple interacting creatures or effects.\\n\\n4. **No Mana Production Mechanism**: Without any lands in play, you have no means of producing mana to cast your creature or play further cards.\\n\\n### Possible Strategies:\\n\\n1. **Mana Base Construction**: Prioritize adding at least 20-23 land slots for a proper balance between casting spells and maintaining board control. You'll want to include both basic Swamps and possibly dual lands if you're building in a format that supports them, like Standard or Modern.\\n\\n2. **Additional Zombie Creatures**: To bolster your zombie theme, consider adding more zombies to create synergies such as token generation, card draw, removal effects, and any abilities specific to the zombie tribe (such as regeneration).\\n\\n3. **Support Cards for Zombies**: Cards that buff zombies, provide token generation, or enhance Diregraf Ghoul's ability will improve your deck’s consistency and power.\\n\\n4. **Flexibility in Early Game**: Since Diregraf Ghoul enters the battlefield tapped, having a mix of early game plays (like other one-drop creatures with haste) can help offset this drawback and allow for more aggressive starts when necessary.\\n\\n5. **Removal Spells**: To protect your zombies from being removed by opponent’s threats, consider adding removal spells that target specific creature types or work well against common removal cards.\\n\\n6. **Utility Cards**: Adding utility cards like card draw, life gain, or counterspells can help mitigate the inherent risks of relying heavily on creatures and provide more strategic options in different game scenarios.\\n\\nBy addressing these weaknesses and reinforcing your strengths with a solid mana base and additional zombies, you can build a cohesive and competitive zombie-themed deck.\"}"

      "Recommended card: A black land that can produce a creature token every time it is untapped. This land's role is to provide additional mana and generate token creatures, which help build your zombie army while also creating disruption through token-focused strategies.\n",
      "Matching cards: index 0: **Swamp**: A basic land card with no color identity that taps to add one black mana. It plays a foundational role in black-themed decks by providing the necessary mana for casting spells and summoning creatures or enchantments that require black mana. Its strength lies in its simplicity and utility, as it doesn't have any abilities beyond mana generation. However, it's limited to producing only black mana, so you'll need other land types to support additional colors if your deck uses them. Overall, Swamp is a weak but essential component of many black decks.\n",
      "index 1: **Diregraf Ghoul**: A black 1-mana Zombie creature. It has a power and toughness of 2/2.   **Role & Strengths**: Diregraf Ghoul serves as an early-game zombie token generator, allowing you to create additional threats or resources quickly. Its ability to tap upon entering the battlefield makes it slightly slower in combat but is often offset by its ability to generate tokens.  **Weaknesses**: It enters the battlefield tapped, which can delay its immediate impact on board presence compared to untapped creatures. Additionally, as a 2/2 for only one mana, it's somewhat fragile and may be easily dealt with by stronger opponents if left alone.  Overall, Diregraf Ghoul is a strong early-game play that helps bolster zombie tribal decks or those seeking quick board development.\n",
      "index 2: **Suspicious Shambler**  *Mana Cost:* {3}{B} (Moderate cost)  *Sorcery-Speed Activation Ability:*   - Requires sacrificing the card from your graveyard by paying an additional {4}{B}{B}.  - Creates two 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens.  *Strengths:*  - Provides flexibility as it can be used to generate board presence after death. - The ability to create two tokens offers significant value, especially in token-based strategies or when looking for a way to turn the tide of the game. - As Zombies, these creatures fit well into black's typical themes and synergies.  *Weaknesses:*  - Expensive activation cost requires building up your graveyard and having sufficient mana available. - The need to activate as a sorcery limits its use in response to an opponent’s actions.  - Requires the card to be in the graveyard, which might not always align with your game plan or board state.  Overall, Suspicious Shambler is a strong value-generating card when used effectively but requires careful setup and timing due to its activation cost and conditions.\n",
      "index 3: **Dread Summons**  - **Mana Cost**: {X}{B}{B}     - This is considered a strong cost for a sorcery. The additional black mana allows it to be flexible and powerful.  - **Keywords**: Mill     - This card causes each player to mill X cards, which can lead to significant board impact depending on the value of X chosen.  - **Role and Strengths**:     - Dread Summons is a mill deck enabler. It excels in decks that aim to deplete opponents' libraries while simultaneously generating threats.   - For every creature card milled by any player, you create a tapped 2/2 black Zombie token, providing potential board presence.   - It can be used defensively or offensively, depending on the context and number of creatures in players' graveyards.  - **Weaknesses**:     - The effectiveness is highly dependent on the value of X chosen. If opponents have fewer creature cards in their libraries, the token generation diminishes.   - Requires a well-timed play to maximize its potential, often needing prior setup or knowledge of your opponent's deck composition.\n",
      "index 4: **Brass's Bounty** is a red sorcery that generates significant value through land synergy. By creating a Treasure token for each land you control, it effectively turns your lands into sources of mana when those tokens are sacrificed. This can lead to a strong burst of resources, especially in decks with many lands or that run out quickly. Its strength lies in its ability to provide flexible mana and accelerate spells or abilities that require multiple colors. However, its weakness is that it requires you to have a sizable board presence of lands at the moment of casting, which might not always be feasible against fast aggro strategies or control decks that disrupt your setup. Overall, Brass's Bounty excels in decks designed to ramp quickly and make use of their land count for powerful plays.\n"

      "Recommended card: A strong dual land that taps for black and red mana, providing versatility and options for your strategy. This land can be used to fix your mana base, enabling you to cast powerful spells or summon creatures that require both colors, such as those with unique abilities or high-impact effects. Its synergy with your deck's strategy is strong, as it enhances the flexibility of your gameplay by allowing access to a wider range of card options and potential game-winning moves. This land addresses the current weakness in the mana base, ensuring consistent mana production across various spells and creatures. Additionally, its dual nature makes it an excellent choice for a creature-focused deck like this one, as it provides the necessary black mana while also offering access to red's powerful abilities or offensive strategies.\n",
      "Matching cards: index 0: **Name:** Mountain  **Mana Cost and Color Identity:** This card is a colorless basic land with no mana cost. It taps for red mana.  **Role and Strengths:** The primary role of Mountain is to provide the player with red mana, which is essential for casting red spells in your deck. Its ability to produce mana makes it highly flexible and crucial for executing strategies that rely on red spells.  **Weaknesses:** As a land, Mountain can only tap for one color (red), limiting its utility if your deck requires multiple colors of mana. It doesn't have additional abilities or synergies beyond providing red mana.  Overall, while the card itself is simple, it plays an essential role in any red-focused deck by ensuring you have enough resources to cast spells efficiently.\n",
      "index 1: **Bloodfell Caves**: This is a colorless dual land that enters the battlefield tapped. It provides two mana options: Black ({B}) or Red ({R}). When it enters the battlefield, you gain 1 life. The mana cost and tapping ability are relatively weak compared to some other lands, but its utility comes from offering flexibility in mana fixing for decks running both black and red spells. Its dual nature makes it versatile, though entering tapped can be a drawback if you require an immediate untapped land drop. Overall, Bloodfell Caves is strong in multicolor decks that need access to both colors without dedicating a full land slot.\n",
      "index 2: **Dimir Guildgate**  - **Type**: Land (Subtype: Gate) - **Mana Cost**: Colorless (No mana cost to play)  **Role and Abilities**: - **Dual-Color Support**: Dimir Guildgate is a versatile land that supports both blue and black spells in your deck. When tapped, it can add either one blue mana ({U}) or one black mana ({B}), making it crucial for casting spells requiring these colors.    **Strengths**: - **Flexibility**: Its ability to provide either blue or black mana makes it an excellent choice for decks that need both colors, allowing for smoother gameplay and more consistent access to your spell library.  **Weaknesses**: - **Limited Use in Mono-Colored Decks**: In decks that primarily focus on a single color (either all blue or all black), Dimir Guildgate offers no additional advantage over regular land types, limiting its utility to multi-color strategies.   Overall, Dimir Guildgate is strong for dual-colored decks, providing essential mana flexibility and support for casting spells efficiently.\n",
      "index 3: **Dismal Backwater** is a dual land that provides flexibility in your mana base with no color requirement to play. It enters the battlefield tapped but compensates by allowing you to gain 1 life as an added benefit upon entering the battlefield. Its main function is to offer two options: it can produce either blue or black mana each turn, represented by {U} or {B}, respectively. This versatility makes it particularly useful in decks that require both of these colors, as it helps stabilize your mana early on. The downside is that entering tapped means you won’t be able to use the land for casting a spell on the very first turn unless you have another untap effect. Its strengths lie in its ability to smooth out your color needs while providing life gain, making it a solid choice for any deck needing both blue and black mana without dedicating additional cards solely as lands.\n",

      "The synergy between this land and your zombie theme is strong, as it can be used to power up zombie creatures or provide an immediate source of damage to pressure the opponent early in the game. The ability to deal damage at the beginning of the end step means it can effectively shut down early aggression or disrupt the opponent's strategy by forcing them to manage their life total. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the fact that it enters tapped but still provides a unique ability makes it a versatile addition to your manabase.

      "Matching cards: index 0: **Diregraf Ghoul**: A black 1-mana Zombie creature. It has a power and toughness of 2/2.   **Role & Strengths**: Diregraf Ghoul serves as an early-game zombie token generator, allowing you to create additional threats or resources quickly. Its ability to tap upon entering the battlefield makes it slightly slower in combat but is often offset by its ability to generate tokens.  **Weaknesses**: It enters the battlefield tapped, which can delay its immediate impact on board presence compared to untapped creatures. Additionally, as a 2/2 for only one mana, it's somewhat fragile and may be easily dealt with by stronger opponents if left alone.  Overall, Diregraf Ghoul is a strong early-game play that helps bolster zombie tribal decks or those seeking quick board development.\n",
      "index 1: **Blossoming Sands**: This is a dual land that enters the battlefield tapped. When it lands, you immediately gain 1 life, which can be beneficial for maintaining your health in longer games. It provides flexible mana options as it can tap to add either green ({G}) or white ({W}), making it versatile for decks that utilize both colors. The main strength of Blossoming Sands is its life-gaining ability and dual-color mana production, although entering tapped might slightly delay early plays compared to lands that enter untapped. It's particularly valuable in decks focused on resilience and using spells from either green or white color.\n",
      "index 2: **Death Baron**  *Mana Cost: {1}{B}{B}*  **Role & Strengths:**   Death Baron is a Zombie Wizard that provides significant value through its ability, which enhances both Skeletons you control and other Zombies with +1/+1 and deathtouch. This makes it particularly powerful in decks focusing on Zombies or utilizing multiple Skeleton tokens since it effectively increases the power of your creatures and allows them to destroy any creature they deal damage to.  **Weaknesses:**   Despite its strengths, Death Baron is relatively weak as a standalone threat due to its low toughness of 2, making it vulnerable to removal. Additionally, its impact relies heavily on having multiple Zombies or Skeletons on the board, which can limit its effectiveness in decks that don't naturally generate them.  Overall, Death Baron excels when integrated into strategies that maximize its ability to buff and leverage deathtouch among your Zombie creatures.\n",
      "index 3: **Temple of Malady** is a dual land with blue and green mana symbols, allowing you to add either black (B) or green (G) mana. It enters the battlefield tapped, providing flexibility in your initial setup without being overly disruptive since it's only one point of tempo loss.  The primary feature of Temple of Malady is its scry ability, which triggers when the land enters the battlefield. Scrying 1 allows you to look at the top card of your library and choose whether to place it on the bottom or leave it on top. This can help smooth out your draws by ensuring future turns have more useful cards.  In terms of role, Temple of Malady is a mana fixer that supports decks looking for both black and green mana sources. Its scry ability adds value over time, making it a solid choice in decks where consistent draw quality is important. The land's drawback is its tapped status on entry, but this is minor compared to the strategic advantage provided by the scry effect. Overall, Temple of Malady is a versatile and valuable addition to many green or black-based decks.\n",
      "index 4: **Azorius Guildgate**  - **Mana Colors:** Colorless (White/Blue) - **Role and Functionality:** This is a dual land that provides access to both white and blue mana. It enters the battlefield tapped but can untap during your turn, allowing for strategic planning in deck construction. - **Strengths:**   - Provides flexibility by offering either {W} or {U}, useful for decks needing multiple colors of spells.   - Can be a staple in decks that require a high number of colorless mana sources to support other lands like shocklands or fetchlands. - **Weaknesses:**   - Enters the battlefield tapped, which can slow down early plays unless paired with untap effects or other lands to ensure consistent mana flow.  Overall, Azorius Guildgate is a versatile and efficient land for decks that utilize both white and blue spells, making it an essential component in many control and tempo strategies.\n"

This can be powerful for reusing creatures that have impactful abilities or effects, essentially allowing you to play them again without needing to draw them from your deck.  - **Role and Strengths:**   - It's particularly strong in decks focusing on recursion or those featuring creatures with death triggers.   - Offers a way to get around mana constraints by utilizing cards already in the graveyard.   - Can be used tactically to surprise opponents by bringing back powerful threats.  - **Weaknesses:**   - Only targets creature cards, limiting its utility compared to more flexible reanimation options.   - Requires a creature card to be in your graveyard, which can sometimes be difficult if you are not controlling board wipes or similar effects.   Overall, Zombify is a solid choice for decks that benefit from repeating powerful creatures and taking advantage of their graveyard abilities.\n",
      "index 1: **Cemetery Recruitment**: A budget-friendly black sorcery that allows you to return a target creature card from your graveyard to your hand. Its strength lies in its ability to potentially recur key creatures or finish off the game with an impactful Zombie. If the returned card is a Zombie, you also draw a card, adding further value. This makes it particularly strong when paired with cards that rely on the Zombie subtype. The main weakness is the requirement of targeting, which can be hindered by opponents' spells and abilities, but its low mana cost mitigates this somewhat.\n",
      "index 2: **Dismal Backwater** is a dual land that provides flexibility in your mana base with no color requirement to play. It enters the battlefield tapped but compensates by allowing you to gain 1 life as an added benefit upon entering the battlefield. Its main function is to offer two options: it can produce either blue or black mana each turn, represented by {U} or {B}, respectively. This versatility makes it particularly useful in decks that require both of these colors, as it helps stabilize your mana early on. The downside is that entering tapped means you won’t be able to use the land for casting a spell on the very first turn unless you have another untap effect. Its strengths lie in its ability to smooth out your color needs while providing life gain, making it a solid choice for any deck needing both blue and black mana without dedicating additional cards solely as lands.\n",
      "index 3: **Macabre Waltz**: A black sorcery with a mana cost of {1}{B}, which is moderately low. This card allows you to return up to two target creature cards from your graveyard to your hand. It's strong for reusing powerful creatures that have died, providing flexibility and resilience in your strategy. However, the drawback is that you must discard a card afterwards, which can be a downside if you don't manage your resources carefully. This makes it most effective when combined with cards that mitigate or leverage discarding to your advantage. It's a situational card but can be very powerful in decks focused on graveyard interaction and recursion.\n",
      "index 4: **Soul-Shackled Zombie**  Mana Cost: {3}{B} (moderate cost)  Type: Creature — Zombie  Power/Toughness: 4/2  Role and Strengths: - **Graveyard Disruption**: Upon entering the battlefield, Soul-Shackled Zombie can exile up to two cards from a single graveyard. This ability is strong for disrupting opponents by removing potentially useful cards that could be reused or recur. - **Life Gain/Loss Trigger**: If at least one creature card is exiled, each opponent loses 2 life while you gain 2 life, providing both removal of threats and life swing beneficial in aggressive strategies.  Weaknesses: - **Conditional Effectiveness**: The impact is maximized when it can exile creature cards. It may be less effective if the targeted graveyards have no or few creature cards. - **Lack of Additional Abilities**: While strong in its disruption role, it doesn't provide additional utility beyond graveyard interaction and life gain.  Overall, Soul-Shackled Zombie serves as a solid midrange card that excels at both disrupting opponents' strategies via graveyard interactions and offering potential life swings.\n"

      "Recommended card:  A strong, black creature with haste that can be played early in the game and provides a good start for your zombie theme.\n",
      "Matching cards: index 0: **Diregraf Ghoul**: A black 1-mana Zombie creature. It has a power and toughness of 2/2.   **Role & Strengths**: Diregraf Ghoul serves as an early-game zombie token generator, allowing you to create additional threats or resources quickly. Its ability to tap upon entering the battlefield makes it slightly slower in combat but is often offset by its ability to generate tokens.  **Weaknesses**: It enters the battlefield tapped, which can delay its immediate impact on board presence compared to untapped creatures. Additionally, as a 2/2 for only one mana, it's somewhat fragile and may be easily dealt with by stronger opponents if left alone.  Overall, Diregraf Ghoul is a strong early-game play that helps bolster zombie tribal decks or those seeking quick board development.\n",
      "index 1: **Hungry Ghoul**: A common black Zombie creature with 2 power and 2 toughness, costing {1}{B}. Hungry Ghoul offers versatility in combat by allowing you to sacrifice another creature to add a +1/+1 counter to it. This ability strengthens the Ghoul incrementally, enhancing its durability or offensive capability over time.  **Role**: Primarily used for board control, enabling aggressive plays by sacrificing weaker creatures to bolster a more significant threat. Its sacrifice requirement can also help manage your hand size and resource pool.  **Strengths**: The card's value increases with each sacrificed creature, making it efficient in decks that generate or support sacrifice mechanics. It's particularly strong in black-centric decks focused on creature interactions and removal strategies.  **Weaknesses**: Its reliance on sacrificing creatures means its power can be limited if you lack other expendable creatures to sacrifice. Additionally, without a sufficient number of creatures on the board, its ability becomes less impactful early game.\n",
      "index 2: **Vampire Spawn**  *Mana Cost:* {2}{B} (Moderate cost with a black mana component)  *Role:* Aggro creature  *Strengths:* - Provides an aggressive start by dealing damage and gaining life when it enters the battlefield. - Its ability triggers upon entering, making it effective in decks focused on maintaining or increasing life totals while pressuring opponents.  *Weaknesses:* - Relatively low power and toughness for a 3-cost creature, making it vulnerable to removal. - Requires an opponent's presence to activate its life-gain and damage-dealing ability, limiting utility if played first turn against an empty board.   Overall, Vampire Spawn is a strong early-game threat in aggro or lifegain strategies, but lacks staying power due to its lower toughness and reliance on opponents for its ability to be impactful.\n",
      "index 3: **Midnight Reaper**: A black Zombie Knight with power 3 and toughness 2. This rare creature costs {2}{B}, which is moderately difficult to cast.  **Role & Strengths**: Midnight Reaper thrives in decks focused on sacrificing creatures or those that frequently have creatures die, such as mill strategies. It synergizes well with effects that force opponents to kill your creatures or with cards that allow you to sacrifice them for value.  - **Self-Sacrifice Synergy**: Pairs excellently with spells or abilities that let you sacrifice creatures for additional benefits.    - **Mill Strategy**: Works effectively in mill decks, where drawing more cards is advantageous as you deplete an opponent's library.  **Weaknesses**:  - **Self-Damage**: The drawback of dealing 1 damage to yourself whenever a nontoken creature dies can be significant, especially if your creatures are dying rapidly due to board wipes or combat.    - **Situational Utility**: Its utility is highly dependent on the specific game plan and deck build. It may not perform well in decks that don't focus on creature sacrifices.  Overall, Midnight Reaper is a powerful card for decks built around sacrificing creatures but requires careful management of its self-damage ability to maximize its benefits.\n",
      "index 4: **Death Baron**  *Mana Cost: {1}{B}{B}*  **Role & Strengths:**   Death Baron is a Zombie Wizard that provides significant value through its ability, which enhances both Skeletons you control and other Zombies with +1/+1 and deathtouch. This makes it particularly powerful in decks focusing on Zombies or utilizing multiple Skeleton tokens since it effectively increases the power of your creatures and allows them to destroy any creature they deal damage to.  **Weaknesses:**   Despite its strengths, Death Baron is relatively weak as a standalone threat due to its low toughness of 2, making it vulnerable to removal. Additionally, its impact relies heavily on having multiple Zombies or Skeletons on the board, which can limit its effectiveness in decks that don't naturally generate them.  Overall, Death Baron excels when integrated into strategies that maximize its ability to buff and leverage deathtouch among your Zombie creatures.\n"

It can also be employed offensively to remove opposing blockers.  - **Strengths**:    - Low mana cost makes it efficient for quick plays.   - The immediate effect can prevent or minimize damage from aggressive creatures or eliminate problematic blockers, thus maintaining tempo and board control.  - **Weaknesses**:   - Its one-target limitation means you may need multiple copies to handle several threats simultaneously.   - It's situational; if the creature doesn't pose a significant threat or if there are more pressing plays available, its utility can be limited.

      "- 3 x Death Baron: **Death Baron**  *Mana Cost: {1}{B}{B}*  **Role & Strengths:**   Death Baron is a Zombie Wizard that provides significant value through its ability, which enhances both Skeletons you control and other Zombies with +1/+1 and deathtouch. This makes it particularly powerful in decks focusing on Zombies or utilizing multiple Skeleton tokens since it effectively increases the power of your creatures and allows them to destroy any creature they deal damage to.  **Weaknesses:**   Despite its strengths, Death Baron is relatively weak as a standalone threat due to its low toughness of 2, making it vulnerable to removal. Additionally, its impact relies heavily on having multiple Zombies or Skeletons on the board, which can limit its effectiveness in decks that don't naturally generate them.  Overall, Death Baron excels when integrated into strategies that maximize its ability to buff and leverage deathtouch among your Zombie creatures.\n",
      "- 1 x Diregraf Ghoul: **Diregraf Ghoul**: A black 1-mana Zombie creature. It has a power and toughness of 2/2.   **Role & Strengths**: Diregraf Ghoul serves as an early-game zombie token generator, allowing you to create additional threats or resources quickly. Its ability to tap upon entering the battlefield makes it slightly slower in combat but is often offset by its ability to generate tokens.  **Weaknesses**: It enters the battlefield tapped, which can delay its immediate impact on board presence compared to untapped creatures. Additionally, as a 2/2 for only one mana, it's somewhat fragile and may be easily dealt with by stronger opponents if left alone.  Overall, Diregraf Ghoul is a strong early-game play that helps bolster zombie tribal decks or those seeking quick board development.\n",
      "- 1 x Crow of Dark Tidings: **Crow of Dark Tidings**  *Crow of Dark Tidings* is a black Zombie Bird with flying. It has a moderate mana cost of {2}{B}. Its main role revolves around its mill ability, which triggers when it enters the battlefield or dies, forcing you to put the top two cards of your library into your graveyard.  **Strengths:** - Provides consistent milling, helping thin your deck and increase the chances of drawing your win conditions. - Flying makes it a versatile attacker that can target players or planeswalkers without being blocked by non-flying creatures. - The triggers on both entering and dying make it useful for various strategies, including self-mill or using its death trigger multiple times with cards like *Regrowth*.  **Weaknesses:** - Its low toughness makes it vulnerable to removal spells. - Requires specific deck strategies that benefit from milling or rely on the card's triggered abilities.   Overall, Crow of Dark Tidings is a strategic choice for decks focused on graveyard manipulation and consistent cycling of cards.\n",

      "Recommended card:  A cheap, weak, black creature with flying that can be played early in the game\n",
      "Matching cards: index 0: **Mocking Sprite**: A blue Faerie Rogue with flying. This creature is moderately easy to play at a mana cost of {2}{U}. Its primary strength lies in its ability to reduce the casting cost of your instant and sorcery spells by {1}, providing you significant flexibility and efficiency, especially if you have many low-cost spells in your deck. While its power and toughness are modest, making it somewhat vulnerable to removal or combat tricks, its strategic value comes from enabling more rapid deployment of your spells. A key weakness is its low durability on the battlefield due to its minimal toughness. It's well-suited for control strategies where maintaining spell advantage is crucial.\n",
      "index 1: **Vampire Interloper**: A Black 2-drop with Flying that is weak defensively due to its inability to block. As a Vampire Scout, it has the potential for aggressive strategies, especially in tribal decks, where its low toughness can be mitigated by lifelink or other Vampire buffs. Its role often centers around quickly pressuring opponents while taking advantage of its flying capability. The drawback is that you must protect it as it cannot block incoming threats, making it vulnerable to removal.\n",
      "index 2: **Empyrean Eagle** is a blue and white creature card that costs {1}{W}{U} to play, which is considered a moderate mana cost. It has the Flying ability, making it immune to most ground-based attacks. Additionally, it provides a team-building effect by granting +1/+1 to all other creatures you control with Flying.  **Role:** Empyrean Eagle serves as an enabler for flying strategies, enhancing your aerial threats and potentially turning even weaker flyers into more substantial blockers or attackers.  **Strengths:** - Boosts the power and toughness of all flying creatures you control, synergizing well in decks focused on flying. - Provides a straightforward way to enhance board presence with minimal additional investment.  **Weaknesses:** - Requires an established team of flying creatures to be truly effective. - Vulnerable to non-flying removal or strategies that don't rely heavily on creatures.\n",
      "index 3: **Broken Wings**  *Mana Cost:* 2 Green (moderate cost)  *Type:* Instant  *Keywords:* None  *Role & Strengths:* Broken Wings is a removal spell targeting creatures with the flying ability. It's versatile in dismantling problematic flyers your opponent might have on the battlefield, including powerful or threatening ones like dragons or flying beaters.  *Weaknesses:* Its specificity to only target creatures with flying limits its utility against other threats that don't possess this keyword, such as non-flying artifacts and enchantments. Additionally, being an instant means it requires careful timing in your hand for the best use.   Overall, Broken Wings is a strong tool for controlling the board from aerial threats but can be situational depending on the game state.\n",
      "index 4: **Fleeting Flight** is a white instant with a low mana cost of one colorless and one white mana. This card serves as an efficient way to temporarily enhance a creature's combat capabilities. It places a +1/+1 counter on the targeted creature, increasing its power and toughness, while also granting it flying until end of turn, allowing it to evade ground-based blockers. Additionally, Fleeting Flight provides damage prevention for that creature this turn, ensuring it survives any combat encounters during this time frame. The card's main strengths lie in its ability to quickly boost a creature for immediate impact and protect it from harm, making it particularly useful in tight situations where an extra edge is needed. However, the effects are temporary, lasting only until end of turn, which limits its long-term strategic value.\n"

      "- 4 x black land: black land\n",
      "- 4 x red land: red land\n",
      "- 8 x white land: white land\n",
      "- 1 x Swamp: **Swamp**: A basic land card with no color identity that taps to add one black mana. It plays a foundational role in black-themed decks by providing the necessary mana for casting spells and summoning creatures or enchantments that require black mana. Its strength lies in its simplicity and utility, as it doesn't have any abilities beyond mana generation. However, it's limited to producing only black mana, so you'll need other land types to support additional colors if your deck uses them. Overall, Swamp is a weak but essential component of many black decks.\n",
      "- 2 x Dismal Backwater: **Dismal Backwater** is a dual land that provides flexibility in your mana base with no color requirement to play. It enters the battlefield tapped but compensates by allowing you to gain 1 life as an added benefit upon entering the battlefield. Its main function is to offer two options: it can produce either blue or black mana each turn, represented by {U} or {B}, respectively. This versatility makes it particularly useful in decks that require both of these colors, as it helps stabilize your mana early on. The downside is that entering tapped means you won’t be able to use the land for casting a spell on the very first turn unless you have another untap effect. Its strengths lie in its ability to smooth out your color needs while providing life gain, making it a solid choice for any deck needing both blue and black mana without dedicating additional cards solely as lands.\n",
      "## creatures: 19\n",
      "- 4 x Diregraf Ghoul: **Diregraf Ghoul**: A black 1-mana Zombie creature. It has a power and toughness of 2/2.   **Role & Strengths**: Diregraf Ghoul serves as an early-game zombie token generator, allowing you to create additional threats or resources quickly. Its ability to tap upon entering the battlefield makes it slightly slower in combat but is often offset by its ability to generate tokens.  **Weaknesses**: It enters the battlefield tapped, which can delay its immediate impact on board presence compared to untapped creatures. Additionally, as a 2/2 for only one mana, it's somewhat fragile and may be easily dealt with by stronger opponents if left alone.  Overall, Diregraf Ghoul is a strong early-game play that helps bolster zombie tribal decks or those seeking quick board development.\n",
      "- 1 x Death Baron: **Death Baron**  *Mana Cost: {1}{B}{B}*  **Role & Strengths:**   Death Baron is a Zombie Wizard that provides significant value through its ability, which enhances both Skeletons you control and other Zombies with +1/+1 and deathtouch. This makes it particularly powerful in decks focusing on Zombies or utilizing multiple Skeleton tokens since it effectively increases the power of your creatures and allows them to destroy any creature they deal damage to.  **Weaknesses:**   Despite its strengths, Death Baron is relatively weak as a standalone threat due to its low toughness of 2, making it vulnerable to removal. Additionally, its impact relies heavily on having multiple Zombies or Skeletons on the board, which can limit its effectiveness in decks that don't naturally generate them.  Overall, Death Baron excels when integrated into strategies that maximize its ability to buff and leverage deathtouch among your Zombie creatures.\n",
      "- 2 x Burglar Rat: **Burglar Rat**  *Burglar Rat* is a black (B) creature with a mana cost of {1}{B}, indicating it's moderately affordable. As a 1/1 Rat, its power and toughness are low, meaning it can be easily defeated in combat. Its primary strength lies in its triggered ability: when *Burglar Rat* enters the battlefield, each opponent must discard a card. This makes it particularly effective for disrupting opponents by depleting their hand resources, especially against decks with more cards or higher mana costs per turn.   The key role of *Burglar Rat* is as an aggressive disruption tool, allowing players to thin opponents' hands while maintaining board presence. However, its low toughness means it can be vulnerable in combat situations and may require protection from spells or abilities that target creatures. Despite this weakness, the card's utility shines in decks focused on controlling the flow of the game through hand disruption.\n",
      "- 1 x Gigantosaurus: **Gigantosaurus**: This is a strong Green creature card with a high mana cost of five Green mana symbols. It features impressive stats for both power and toughness at 10/10, making it a formidable presence on the battlefield in terms of durability and combat capability. As a Dinosaur subtype, Gigantosaurus can synergize well with other cards that have bonuses or effects involving Dinosaurs, amplifying its role as a powerhouse creature.  **Strengths**:  - High stats (10/10) provide both strong offensive and defensive capabilities. - Can be a game-changer in combat due to its significant power and toughness. - Synergizes well with Dinosaur-themed decks for enhanced performance.  **Weaknesses**: - The high mana cost makes it difficult to play early in the game, requiring time and resources to get on board. - It lacks additional abilities or effects beyond its strong stats, which can make it less versatile compared to creatures that have utility keywords or special abilities.\n",
      "- 1 x Hungry Ghoul: **Hungry Ghoul**: A common black Zombie creature with 2 power and 2 toughness, costing {1}{B}. Hungry Ghoul offers versatility in combat by allowing you to sacrifice another creature to add a +1/+1 counter to it. This ability strengthens the Ghoul incrementally, enhancing its durability or offensive capability over time.  **Role**: Primarily used for board control, enabling aggressive plays by sacrificing weaker creatures to bolster a more significant threat. Its sacrifice requirement can also help manage your hand size and resource pool.  **Strengths**: The card's value increases with each sacrificed creature, making it efficient in decks that generate or support sacrifice mechanics. It's particularly strong in black-centric decks focused on creature interactions and removal strategies.  **Weaknesses**: Its reliance on sacrificing creatures means its power can be limited if you lack other expendable creatures to sacrifice. Additionally, without a sufficient number of creatures on the board, its ability becomes less impactful early game.\n",
      "- 2 x Ball Lightning: **Ball Lightning**: A red Elemental creature with haste and trample. It has a high power of 6 but low toughness of 1, making it strong in offense but weak defensively. The mana cost is {R}{R}{R}, which is considered expensive, requiring three red mana to cast. Its ability to attack immediately upon entering the battlefield provides early impact in combat. However, its self-sacrifice trigger at the beginning of the end step requires careful timing and planning to maximize its effectiveness, as it will not survive long after attacking unless additional effects keep it on the board or prolong its presence somehow. This card is best used for quick, powerful strikes rather than sustained threats.\n",
      "- 1 x Maalfeld Twins: **Maalfeld Twins**  Mana Cost: {5}{B} (Moderate cost; requires a significant investment in black mana)  Type: Creature - Zombie  Role and Strengths: - Maalfeld Twins is a resilient zombie creature with decent stats, providing strong blocking capabilities. - Its primary strength lies in its death trigger. When it dies, you gain an immediate advantage by creating two 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens. This makes it a consistent threat, rewarding sacrifice plays or aggressive strategies that aim to trade down creatures.  Weaknesses: - With a moderate mana cost of {5}{B}, Maalfeld Twins requires careful deck building and mana management. - Its effectiveness is somewhat dependent on your ability to deal with board control tactics since it needs to die to activate its powerful death trigger.   Overall, Maalfeld Twins excels in decks that can leverage its zombie tokens for continued pressure or defense.\n",
      "- 2 x Vampire Interloper: **Vampire Interloper**: A Black 2-drop with Flying that is weak defensively due to its inability to block. As a Vampire Scout, it has the potential for aggressive strategies, especially in tribal decks, where its low toughness can be mitigated by lifelink or other Vampire buffs. Its role often centers around quickly pressuring opponents while taking advantage of its flying capability. The drawback is that you must protect it as it cannot block incoming threats, making it vulnerable to removal.\n",
      "- 1 x Flamewake Phoenix: **Flamewake Phoenix**  This red creature has flying and haste. With a mana cost of two reds plus one generic, it's considered a mid-range investment for its abilities. It boasts an aggressive nature by attacking each combat if able, making it a consistent offensive threat. Its toughness is weak at 2, so protecting it is crucial.  A significant aspect of Flamewake Phoenix is its ability to return from the graveyard during your turn's beginning of combat step if you control a creature with power 4 or greater and pay one red mana. This makes it resilient and allows for repeated use in games where larger creatures are present.   The card excels when part of an aggressive deck that can field strong creatures, leveraging its recurring ability to maintain pressure on the opponent. However, its low toughness is a notable weakness, requiring strategies or other cards to ensure its survival long enough to be effective.\n",
      "- 2 x Suspicious Shambler: **Suspicious Shambler**  *Mana Cost:* {3}{B} (Moderate cost)  *Sorcery-Speed Activation Ability:*   - Requires sacrificing the card from your graveyard by paying an additional {4}{B}{B}.  - Creates two 2/2 black Zombie creature tokens.  *Strengths:*  - Provides flexibility as it can be used to generate board presence after death. - The ability to create two tokens offers significant value, especially in token-based strategies or when looking for a way to turn the tide of the game. - As Zombies, these creatures fit well into black's typical themes and synergies.  *Weaknesses:*  - Expensive activation cost requires building up your graveyard and having sufficient mana available. - The need to activate as a sorcery limits its use in response to an opponent’s actions.  - Requires the card to be in the graveyard, which might not always align with your game plan or board state.  Overall, Suspicious Shambler is a strong value-generating card when used effectively but requires careful setup and timing due to its activation cost and conditions.\n",
      "- 1 x Vampire Soulcaller: **Vampire Soulcaller** is a black creature with flying. It has a moderate mana cost of {4}{B}. As a Vampire and Warlock, it plays well in aggressive or graveyard-centric decks. The card can't block, which is a weakness since it relies on others to protect it. Its main strength lies in its ability to return a target creature card from your graveyard to your hand when it enters the battlefield, providing strong value by helping you reuse powerful creatures without needing to recast them from your deck. This makes it particularly potent in strategies that focus on utilizing the graveyard as an engine for recurring threats and effects.\n",
      "- 1 x Soul-Shackled Zombie: **Soul-Shackled Zombie**  Mana Cost: {3}{B} (moderate cost)  Type: Creature — Zombie  Power/Toughness: 4/2  Role and Strengths: - **Graveyard Disruption**: Upon entering the battlefield, Soul-Shackled Zombie can exile up to two cards from a single graveyard. This ability is strong for disrupting opponents by removing potentially useful cards that could be reused or recur. - **Life Gain/Loss Trigger**: If at least one creature card is exiled, each opponent loses 2 life while you gain 2 life, providing both removal of threats and life swing beneficial in aggressive strategies.  Weaknesses: - **Conditional Effectiveness**: The impact is maximized when it can exile creature cards. It may be less effective if the targeted graveyards have no or few creature cards. - **Lack of Additional Abilities**: While strong in its disruption role, it doesn't provide additional utility beyond graveyard interaction and life gain.  Overall, Soul-Shackled Zombie serves as a solid midrange card that excels at both disrupting opponents' strategies via graveyard interactions and offering potential life swings.\n",

      "- 3 x Zombify: **Zombify**  - **Mana Cost:** {3}{B} - Moderately inexpensive.    - **Type:** Sorcery  - **Functionality:** Zombify allows you to return a target creature card from your graveyard directly to the battlefield. This can be powerful for reusing creatures that have impactful abilities or effects, essentially allowing you to play them again without needing to draw them from your deck.  - **Role and Strengths:**   - It's particularly strong in decks focusing on recursion or those featuring creatures with death triggers.   - Offers a way to get around mana constraints by utilizing cards already in the graveyard.   - Can be used tactically to surprise opponents by bringing back powerful threats.  - **Weaknesses:**   - Only targets creature cards, limiting its utility compared to more flexible reanimation options.   - Requires a creature card to be in your graveyard, which can sometimes be difficult if you are not controlling board wipes or similar effects.   Overall, Zombify is a solid choice for decks that benefit from repeating powerful creatures and taking advantage of their graveyard abilities.\n",
      "- 2 x Cemetery Recruitment: **Cemetery Recruitment**: A budget-friendly black sorcery that allows you to return a target creature card from your graveyard to your hand. Its strength lies in its ability to potentially recur key creatures or finish off the game with an impactful Zombie. If the returned card is a Zombie, you also draw a card, adding further value. This makes it particularly strong when paired with cards that rely on the Zombie subtype. The main weakness is the requirement of targeting, which can be hindered by opponents' spells and abilities, but its low mana cost mitigates this somewhat.\n",
      "- 3 x Macabre Waltz: **Macabre Waltz**: A black sorcery with a mana cost of {1}{B}, which is moderately low. This card allows you to return up to two target creature cards from your graveyard to your hand. It's strong for reusing powerful creatures that have died, providing flexibility and resilience in your strategy. However, the drawback is that you must discard a card afterwards, which can be a downside if you don't manage your resources carefully. This makes it most effective when combined with cards that mitigate or leverage discarding to your advantage. It's a situational card but can be very powerful in decks focused on graveyard interaction and recursion.\n",
      "- 2 x Day of Judgment: **Day of Judgment**: This is a white sorcery card with a mana cost of {2}{W}{W}, indicating it requires two generic and two white mana to cast. The primary effect is to destroy all creatures on the battlefield, making it a powerful board wipe that can shift control of the game significantly in your favor.   **Strengths**: It's effective at resetting the board state, particularly useful against decks with many creatures or when you're facing an opponent who has amassed numerous threats. Its ability to clear out both your own and your opponent's creatures can be strategically advantageous.  **Weaknesses**: The card does not target, so it cannot selectively remove individual creatures if needed. Additionally, because it destroys all creatures indiscriminately, including those you might want to keep on the battlefield, timing its use is crucial. It also leaves your board empty immediately after resolving unless countered or protected by other cards.  **Role in Deck**: Day of Judgment serves as a strong finisher in white control decks or any deck capable of stabilizing early and surviving until it can resolve this sweeping effect. It synergizes well with strategies that aim to create temporary advantages on the battlefield.\n",
      "- 1 x Exsanguinate: **Exsanguinate**: A black sorcery with a flexible mana cost of {X}{B}{B}. This card allows you to choose an amount of life (X) each opponent will lose, and then you gain that same amount of life. It serves as both a strong board wipe and a means of gaining significant life, depending on the value chosen for X. The dual benefit makes it powerful in controlling your opponents' health while bolstering your own survival. Its cost requires investment but offers high utility based on how much damage (or life loss) you choose to inflict.\n",
      "- 1 x Angelic Edict: **Angelic Edict**: This is a white sorcery with a mana cost of {4}{W}. It allows you to exile a target creature or enchantment.   - **Role**: Angelic Edict functions as a removal spell that can be used to permanently remove problematic creatures or enchantments from the battlefield, offering strategic advantages by denying your opponent's resources.    - **Strengths**:    - Versatile in its ability to target both creatures and enchantments, making it effective against various threats.   - Provides long-term benefits since exiled cards are often considered out of play for the remainder of the game.  - **Weaknesses**:   - The mana cost {4}{W} is relatively high, requiring a significant investment which can be restrictive in faster-paced games or when other spells need to be played.   - Limited interaction with instants or abilities that are activated mid-turn since it's a sorcery and must be cast during your main phase.  Overall, Angelic Edict is a strong removal option for specific scenarios but requires careful consideration of its timing and resource management.\n",
      "## instants: 10\n",
      "- 1 x Quick Study: **Quick Study**: This is a blue instant with a mana cost of {2}{U}, which is moderately priced. It allows you to draw two cards, providing card advantage and enabling you to find more resources or answers during your turn. Its strength lies in its ability to accelerate your game plan by giving you additional options immediately. However, as it only draws two cards without any other effects, it can be considered a weaker form of card draw compared to multicolor or higher-cost spells that might offer additional benefits or target specific cards. It's best used when you need immediate answers or resources and don't have other ways to draw cards at the moment.\n",
      "- 4 x Stab: **Stab**: A black instant that provides a straightforward and tactical approach to combat or board control. By paying just one mana (B), you can target any single creature on the battlefield and reduce its power and toughness by 2 until end of turn.   - **Role**: Primarily used as an interaction spell in your opponent's attack phase, allowing you to potentially neutralize a key threat during combat. It can also be employed offensively to remove opposing blockers.  - **Strengths**:    - Low mana cost makes it efficient for quick plays.   - The immediate effect can prevent or minimize damage from aggressive creatures or eliminate problematic blockers, thus maintaining tempo and board control.  - **Weaknesses**:   - Its one-target limitation means you may need multiple copies to handle several threats simultaneously.   - It's situational; if the creature doesn't pose a significant threat or if there are more pressing plays available, its utility can be limited.   Overall, Stab is a useful card for players who focus on reactive strategies and want an easy-to-cast option to deal with immediate challenges during combat.\n",
      "- 3 x Mortify: **Mortify**  *Mortify* is a powerful instant spell with a moderate mana cost of {1}{W}{B}. It allows you to destroy either a targeted creature or an enchantment. As an instant, it can be played at any time during your turn or in response to another action, giving you flexibility and tactical advantage.  **Strengths:** - Versatile removal spell that can target both creatures and enchantments. - Instant speed lets you respond to threats or opportunities as they arise, making it a valuable reactive card. - Can swing the board state quickly by removing key permanents from your opponent's side of the battlefield.  **Weaknesses:** - Single-use per casting, limiting its impact unless copied or repeated with another effect. - Targeting requirement means you need an available target to make use of it effectively.  Overall, *Mortify* is a strong removal option in deck builds focusing on creature and enchantment interactions.\n",
      "- 1 x Offer Immortality: **Offer Immortality**: This black instant card allows you to target a single creature on the battlefield, granting it deathtouch and indestructible until end of turn. With its relatively low mana cost ({1}{B}), it is efficient in terms of resource management for an impactful effect. The granted deathtouch means any amount of damage dealt by this creature will be enough to destroy other creatures, while indestructible ensures that even if it takes lethal damage or effects aimed at destroying it are cast, the targeted creature remains on the battlefield.  **Strengths**:  - Offers versatile combat advantage through deathtouch. - Provides a temporary shield against destruction, which can turn the tide of battle by preserving key creatures. - Can be used reactively in response to opponent's actions for a surprise defense or attack boost.  **Weaknesses**:  - Only affects one creature at a time per cast. - The effect is temporary, lasting only until end of turn. - Requires a black mana source which may limit its use if your deck runs low on black cards.   This card serves well in decks that focus on controlling the battlefield and protecting valuable creatures from opponent's removal spells or board wipes.\n",
      "- 1 x Fleeting Flight: **Fleeting Flight** is a white instant with a low mana cost of one colorless and one white mana. This card serves as an efficient way to temporarily enhance a creature's combat capabilities. It places a +1/+1 counter on the targeted creature, increasing its power and toughness, while also granting it flying until end of turn, allowing it to evade ground-based blockers. Additionally, Fleeting Flight provides damage prevention for that creature this turn, ensuring it survives any combat encounters during this time frame. The card's main strengths lie in its ability to quickly boost a creature for immediate impact and protect it from harm, making it particularly useful in tight situations where an extra edge is needed. However, the effects are temporary, lasting only until end of turn, which limits its long-term strategic value.\n",
