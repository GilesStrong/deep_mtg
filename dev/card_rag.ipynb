      "**Double Strike**: This ability allows Zetalpa to deal both first strike damage and regular combat damage in a single combat phase\n",
      "Essentially, it gets in two attacks in one combat step, making it incredibly dangerous against creatures that don't have similar abilities or high toughness\n",
      " 3\n",
      "**Vigilance**: Normally, attacking creatures tap, but vigilance prevents that, allowing Zetalpa to attack and still be able to block if needed in the same turn\n",
      " 4\n",
      "**Trample**: If Zetalpa's damage exceeds the blocking creature's toughness, the remaining damage carries over to the opponent\n",

      " 5\n",

      "It can only be exiled or otherwise removed from the game, not killed in battle or by spells like Incinerate\n",
      " Putting it all together, Zetalpa is a huge, flying dinosaur that can hit hard with double strike, bypass blockers with trample, stay ready to defend with vigilance, and can't be killed by normal means due to being indestructible\n",
      "It's a card that can completely shift the dynamics of the game when played, making it a strong choice for white-based decks that can support its mana cost\n",

      "Banner of Kinship is an interesting artifact from Magic: The Gathering that can significantly boost your creatures of a specific type\n",
      "Let's break down what it does and how you might use it in your deck\n",
      " First off, Banner of Kinship costs five colorless mana to cast, which is represented by {5} in its mana cost\n",
      "This makes it a mid-range spell in terms of cost; not too cheap that it clogs up early game development, but also not so expensive that it's unplayable in the late game\n",
      "The fact that it's an artifact means it can be cast in any deck, regardless of color identity, which adds to its versatility\n",
      " When you cast Banner of Kinship, you get to choose a creature type as it enters the battlefield\n",
      "This choice is crucial because the benefits of the card are tied to this type\n",
      "For example, if you choose Human, then all Human creatures you control will benefit from the card\n",
      " The card enters the battlefield with a number of fellowship counters equal to the number of creatures you currently control of the chosen type\n",
      "So, if you have three Humans on the battlefield when you cast Banner of Kinship and choose Human, the artifact will enter with three fellowship counters\n",
      " The key ability of Banner of Kinship is that it grants +1/+1 to each of your creatures of the chosen type for each fellowship counter on the artifact\n",
      "So, using the previous example, if you have three fellowship counters on Banner of Kinship, all your Humans would get +3/+3 (since 3 counters × +1/+1 per counter = +3/+3)\n",
      "This can be a significant boost and can turn mediocre creatures into real threats\n",
      " One important thing to note is that the fellowship counters are based on the number of creatures of the chosen type you control when Banner of Kinship enters the battlefield\n",
      "If you gain control of more creatures of that type later, or if some die, the number of counters doesn't change\n",
      "Therefore, it's beneficial to have as many creatures of the chosen type on the battlefield as possible when you cast Banner of Kinship\n",
      " This card is particularly powerful in decks that focus on a specific creature type\n",
      "For example, if you're playing a Human tribal deck, Banner of Kinship can provide a substantial boost to all your Humans, making them much stronger attackers and blockers\n",
      "Similarly, in a Merfolk or Elf tribal deck, it can be a game-changer\n",
      " However, there are some weaknesses to consider\n",
      "Since the card is an artifact, it's susceptible to artifact removal spells, which are common in Magic\n",
      "Additionally, if your opponent has ways to remove artifacts or negate their abilities, your Banner of Kinship won't be able to provide the boosts you're hoping for\n",
      " Another consideration is that choosing the right creature type is crucial\n",
      "If you choose a type that isn't well represented on your battlefield, you won't get many counters, and thus, less benefit from the card\n",
      "Therefore, planning ahead and ensuring you have multiple creatures of a specific type before casting Banner of Kinship is important\n",
      " In summary, Banner of Kinship is a powerful artifact that can significantly enhance your creatures of a chosen type by granting them +1/+1 for each fellowship counter on the artifact, which is determined by the number of creatures of that type you control when it enters the battlefield\n",
      "It's most effective in decks that focus on a specific creature type and have multiple creatures of that type on the battlefield when Banner of Kinship is cast\n",

      "This can be really handy for generating card advantage or resetting a permanent to reuse its entering-the-battlefield trigger or to save it from being destroyed\n",

      "It's not going to win combat duels with its 3/1 stats, but its flash and the ability to bounce one of your permanents can be incredibly valuable in certain situations\n",

       "{'summary': '**Island**  This is a basic land card that requires no mana cost to play. Its primary role in your deck is to provide blue mana ({U}), which can be used to cast spells and activate abilities requiring blue mana. The main strength of Island is its ability to generate mana without any additional conditions, making it highly flexible for building various strategies centered around the color blue. There are no inherent weaknesses, but like all lands, it does nothing directly on the battlefield other than produce mana. In decks that heavily rely on blue spells, Islands can be a crucial component in ensuring you have access to necessary resources throughout the game.',\n",
